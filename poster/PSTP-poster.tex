      \begin{block}{Introduction}
        The \alert{physical travelling salesman problem} (PSTP) is an abstraction into the physical world of the well-known travelling salesman optimization problem.
        \vskip1ex

        \begin{itemize}
        \item In regular TSP, the objective is to find a \alert{Hamiltonian path} in a weighted graph with minimum total cost.
        \item In PSTP, the goal is to \alert{minimize the time} that it takes to follow the trajectory of the Hamiltonian path, taking into account \alert{physical laws of motion}.
        \item Solutions for TSP are in general \alert{not optimal} for PSTP, since force needs to be applied to change direction of motion and sharp turns are costly.
        \end{itemize}

        Salesman has a mass of 1 kg. At every time step ($dt = \sqrt{0,1}$), force of 1N can be applied to
        salesman in either X or Y axis. Newton's equations for velocity and displacement are used for the simulation.
        Cities are placed in 320x240 grid and each has a radius of 5m.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item All best solutions used genetic algorithms.
            \item No crossover was used, only mutations.
            \item Most tried to first find a suitable route for visiting the cities and then optimize the corresponding trajectory. 
            %\item Some optimize the route incrementally.
        \end{itemize}

      \begin{block}{Our Approach}
        Similarly to GECCO'05 competition, we divide the problem into \alert{two phases}. In the first phase, we find an optimal \alert{route for visiting} all the cities. In the second phase, we optimize the \alert{corresponding trajectory} \ie the sequence of applied force vectors. We also use an evolutionary approach in both phases.
        \vskip1ex
        \noindent{\textbf{Finding optimal route}}
        
        TSP solutions do not give good results. Need a different heuristic. Explaing heuristic and genetic algorithm.

        Need nice picture with circle's to illustrate trajectory estimation.

        \vskip1ex
        \noindent{\textbf{Generating optimal trajectory}}
        
        We have good route. Need to generate trajectory with force vectors. Explain PID-controller and genetic algorithm.

        Several approaches were tried. The first was to use a \alert{proportional-integral-derivative} (PID) controller.
        The reasoning was, that this.
